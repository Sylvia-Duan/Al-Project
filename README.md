- Data (*t.b.d*) => technology: train an AI model to determine if the patient has heart attack by observing traits of the patient => if successful, the AI model can assist the doctor to make basic judgments in order to reduce the workload of doctors and enable further check-ups to be performed more timely (community impact)
