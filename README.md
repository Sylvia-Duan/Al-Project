# Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset
Team members are Mark Sebastian, Sylvia Duan, Son Nguyen, and Tianyi Zhang
## Data
### Description
Heart attack have been the deadliest form of Heart diease ever known. It been shown that about 17.9 million live have been taken away because of it. As a result, we as a group planning on using dataset and information to predict, prevent, and manage heart attack rate. &nbsp

This is the link of the dataset we will use.
### Importance of data
- Data (*t.b.d*) => technology: train an AI model to determine if the patient has heart attack by observing traits of the patient => if successful, we can know whether we have a heart attack based on known traits of ourselves (no community impact)
- Data (*t.b.d*) => technology: train an AI model to determine if the patient has heart attack by observing traits of the patient => if successful, the AI model can assist the doctor to make basic judgments in order to reduce the workload of doctors and enable further check-ups to be performed more timely (community impact)
