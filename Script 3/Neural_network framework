**add this to the code previously written**
def createModel2():

  *I think it is something to do with the initializers that makes some of the loss functions super high
  model2.add(layers.Dense(50,activation= "relu",  kernel_initializer='normal'))
  model2.add(layers.Dense(2))
  model2.compile(optimizer="SGD", loss = "mse")
  return model2
model2 = createModel2()
##the epochs are 200 because the loss can be super high--- after 200 it goes to about the same as the losses that are normal
model2.fit(x_train,y_train,epochs=200,verbose=1)
model2.evaluate(x_test,y_test)
